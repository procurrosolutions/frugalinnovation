#Frugal Innovation Framework

Background

The current model is broken. We keep creating products that no one really needs that produce waste that nobody wants. Furthermore, we need to start concentrating on the conditions that people live in and what goods and services meet those conditions

The goal of this initiaitve is to create a framework describing what frugal innovation, what conditions require frugal innovation, what tools and techniques are used to create positive outcomes, and the outcomes that frugal innovation has produced
